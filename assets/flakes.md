# Flakes

If you have been using NixOS or used it before, you'll undoubtedly have heard people mention "flakes". In fact I have mentioned them a lot in the text leading up to this chapter. But what are flakes? The name isn't exactly descriptive and everyone seams to describe flakes in different ways? And why would you even want to use flakes?

### What do flakes even do?

Flakes in their most common usage are just version pinning for packages. They replace the `nix-channel` with a more declarative and integrated way of managing channels and other inputs. The `flake.lock` is created by the inputs in the `flake.nix` and this is used to find the exact version of the packagers you want, ensuring full reproducibility.

Flakes also have other features, in fact they have quite a lot of features, maybe even to many. One thing they do is that they do not allow the use of any file that isn't being tracked by git, making sure that the configuration can be recreated with only the repository. But this means having certain files that contain host specific options that isn't tracked by git is no longer an option. But flakes provide a solution to that with another feature.

Flakes provide a way to create multiple predefined configurations with `nixosConfigurations` in the `outputs` function. This is an attribute set of names that correspond to different config files to control all your different devices.

This is essentially what flakes are, an *input-output* control scheme where you can version all your inputs and packages and manage all your different hosts and shells. An example of a minimal operational flake would be:

```nix
{
  description = "My flake!";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs }: {
    nixosConfigurations = {
      "your-hostname" = nixpkgs.lib.nixSystem {
        modules = [ ./configuration.nix ];
      };
    };
  };
}
```

### Inputs

The `inputs` attribute set is what controls what goes into the `flake.lock`. The `.lock` file is what specifies what version your packages use. `inputs` can have any number attributes, but needs at least one `nixpkgs` to specify what version (branch) you want to use as the default for your packages.

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    #====<< Core Nixpkgs >>====================================================>
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    nixpkgs-stable.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-24.05";
    #====<< DEs & Compositors >>===============================================>
    nixos-cosmic.url = "github:lilyinstarlight/nixos-cosmic";
    nixos-cosmic.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };
}
```

`<input>.inputs.nixpkgs.follows` can be used to make the `nixpkgs` input of the flake you are referencing use the same commit as your `nixpkgs`. This way you don't have many different versions of your packages taking up space in your disk.

To access inputs in the configuration the `@inputs` argument is used in the `outputs` function like so:

```nix
outputs = { self, nixpkgs, ... }@inputs:
```

With this we don't have to put each and every input into the argument set, but can instead just reference them in the `inputs` set. To use an example, many flakes provide a `nixosModules` output that imports a bunch of options for you to use, so to access them we would normally import them with just the name of the input + the module, but using the inputs argument we do it like so:

```nix
{ pkgs, inputs, ... }: {
  imports = [ inputs.<inputName>.nixosModules.default ];
}
```

then you need to specify the system.

### Outputs

Configurations

host specific stuff

dev shells

other (pkgs, modules, overlays)

### Flake automation

Library, let bindings

Less is more. if automation is more, then it is less

Snowfall, flake parts, flake utils

### The monolith

Too much?

do you even need them

Middle of the road, use as little as possible, do not use pkgs or modules.
