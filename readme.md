> Welcome to the Sput*Nix* Repository.

This Repository aims to solve one problem: Getting started with NixOS is extremely tedious. The documentation is often really shallow and it's all scattered throughout the internet like a broken vase.

SputNix aims to be a one-stop shop for all the basics that you need in order to have a functional configuration at the start of your NixOS journey with all the features you would have otherwise found yourself rewriting your configuration in order to accommodate, like Flakes, Home-manager or Disko, while also explaining what these are, why you want them and how to modify them to your preference.

It is best if you know some Linux basics and how to navigate a terminal user interface, but this is not required. You should however learn Git as it will make your life much easier, but you can learn it as you go. If you'd rather know before hand what your getting into you can read these short introductions to [Git](./assets/git-basics.md) and the [terminal](./assets/terminal.md) that I wrote, Else go to the [Installation](./assets/installation.md) for getting a new system running or [Existing machine setup](./setup-on-existing-nixos-machine.md) for those already with a working NixOS system.
